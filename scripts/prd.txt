# Overview
ExcaliForSofa is a specialized version of Excalidraw focused on creating accurate sofa measurements for custom cover production. The platform bridges the gap between non-technical customers who need to measure their sofas and professional production teams in China who create custom sofa covers. The application enables users to easily trace sofa contours on photos, add precise measurements, and generate standardized production-ready documentation.

# Core Features
1. **Sofa Photo Integration**: Import and calibrate sofa photos as backgrounds for accurate tracing and measurements.

2. **Specialized Measurement Tools**: Create vector-based measurements with support for different units (inches to 1/8" and cm to 0.1cm) with seamless conversion between them.

3. **Production Template Generation**: Generate standardized PDF templates that include all necessary information for professional production teams.

4. **Measurement Tagging System**: Categorize and label different types of measurements (width, depth, height, seams, zipper locations) for clarity.

5. **Guided Measurement Process**: Step-by-step instructions for customers to ensure accurate measurements.

6. **Collaboration Tools**: Share and communicate about measurements between customers, your team, and production facilities.

7. **Mobile Compatibility**: Allow measurements to be taken on mobile devices directly in customers' homes.

# User Experience
**User Personas**:
- **Home Customers**: Non-technical individuals who need custom sofa covers and have limited experience taking measurements.
- **Customer Service Team**: Staff who help customers verify measurements and prepare production files.
- **Production Team**: Professional sewers and pattern makers in China who need precise technical specifications.

**Key User Flows**:
- Customer uploads sofa photo, traces outlines, adds measurements, and shares with the service team
- Service team reviews measurements, adds production annotations, and generates production templates
- Production team receives standardized templates with all necessary measurements and specifications
- Customer and service team can collaborate on measurement revisions if needed
